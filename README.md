# Shield

Shield is a toolkit for building VPN tunnels in Go. It does not try to
be a full-blown VPN implementation; instead, it provides you with the
building blocks for rolling your own.

## Usage

[example.go] showcases how to use the toolkit to build an unencrypted
point-to-point tunnel. Full documentation is available at [GoDoc].
